# Single Page Application - Todo App

This repo hosts a series of workshops on creating a single page application using React. The workshops are following DCI's curriculum structure. During this project we will use the official [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) of React as our basic reference. Also this [article](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) is a nice way to get started with react. Please bookmark both links for future reference. :crystal_ball:

## The way it works

This repo has several branches with several stages of the development of the final app. For each stage, a list of changes will be added to the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file, to explain the changes made.

If you need a reminder on how this app changed through each of the workshops, simply checkout the branch for the phase you are interested in, and read the changelog.

In addition, branches with the prefix task/ describe the task that needs to be achieved in that change. The tasks are all listed in the TASKS.md file. If you want to start doing things yourself, simply checkout the task branch and make the change. To begin from the start, checkout the task/01-mock-database-and-controllers branch.
